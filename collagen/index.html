    <h3>What Is Collagen?</h3>
    <p>
      Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, playing a vital
      role in maintaining the health and structure of our skin, joints, tendons,
      bones, and muscles. It acts as a glue that holds our tissues together,
      ensuring elasticity and strength. As we age, collagen production naturally
      declines, leading to signs of aging such as wrinkles, joint discomfort,
      and reduced skin elasticity. Supplementing with collagen can help restore
      these levels and support overall health.
